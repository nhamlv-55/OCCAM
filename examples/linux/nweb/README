Specialization of nweb with initial program arguments using the 'nweb.manifest'.

The 'build.sh' script builds the nweb binary which run at port 8181 and serves files out of the subdirectory 'root'. Therefore, specialized binary can be used without any argument (./nweb_slash)

To test the nweb, run

	./nweb 8181 ./root

and connect with

    wget localhost:8181

or 

   curl localhost:8181
