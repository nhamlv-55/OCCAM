-- Previrt -------------------------------------------------------------------

[ ] Debug previrtualized version of httpd. The previrtualized version of httpd
    does not start correctly. It seems likely this is due to interactions with
    pthreads (possibly some incorrectly eliminated symbols?).
[ ] Figure out how to avoid needing to relink in libc, etc. to get the symbols
    we need for the C runtime. (and C++/pthreads?)
[X] Add support for better call-graphs. Either improve Gregory's call graph,
    choose a better one that's already in llvm, or port over the DSA call-graph
    stuff in poolalloc.
[ ] Support for previrtualizing un-named functions
[X] Support for previrtualizing internal function pointers accross module 
    boundaries for call backs.
[ ] To avoid creating multiple clones of the same specialized function, we check
    if it already exists by looking it up in the module by name. This check
    should probably be more robust. This is related to support for un-named
    functions because we need to make sure we're using unique specializations
    for the different functions.
[ ] For ease of understanding, give created globals for strings, etc., names so
    they don't show up as unnamed in the symbol table.
[ ] Extract statistics about the previrtualization process.
